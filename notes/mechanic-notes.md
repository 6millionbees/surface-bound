### <font color="#fffae8">Marrow</font>

Durability. You take less damage, have more health, get hungry slower, and take less damage to poison.

### <font color="#ff2448">Sinew</font>

You deal more damage (pysically). It can also be a requirement for wielding some weapons or doing some tasks. It also allows you to intimidate people. Intimidation will be a battle of sinew between two individuals. If you win the npc suddenly becomes much more agreeable

### <font color="#ffba5f">Tact</font>

Allows you to understand the world around you. Makes you more accurate and quicker. You have a greater understanding of what you perceive with your five senses.

### <font color="#279eff">Acumen</font>

You know more, just in general. You can manipulate people into agreeing with you, you have a way with words. You can understand the mental states of beings and you have a greater understanding of the arcane.<br>
It increases magic damage.

### <font color="#a1fff7">Faith</font>

You trust easier. High faith builds should have more options to just be better people (and get rewarded for it through buffs or other reawards). This stat also increases your mental connection with the divine, buffing the effects of your prayers and holy magic.

### <font color="#37a529">Gifts</font>

You get better stuff from the gods above. The effects of this stat will definitely change during production as I get new ideas for the gameplay. This will affect all the weird shit.

## <span style="color:black; background-color:#fff5">Dying</span>

Some fights are kinda unavoidable if you're in a certain area. I'm thinking the default will be permadeath (so the game shouldn't have one-shot enemies or traps unless you are deeply underleveled). The only exception to the rule will be the easiest difficulty.

The naming scheme for the difficulties should be different types of undead. With the difficulty increasing based on the strength of the undead.

Hardest
<ol>
  <li>Ghoul</li>
  Hardest difficulty only the gods know what kind of punishment it will include
  <li>Fiend</li>
  Slightly harder (I'll figure out how to make it harder later)
  <li>Reanimant</li>
  Recomended difficulty
  <li>Revanant</li>
  A bit easier and you can respawn
</ol>
Easiest
