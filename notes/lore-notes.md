There will be two classifications of gods, Surface and Sepulture.<br>
The entirety of the game will take place in a deep sprawling dungeon built to contain the corpse of a powerful god.

### Of The Surface

These gods are the ones to give you a second (arguably worse) life, they are also the ones to give you powerful gifts that have various effects.


### Of The Sepulture

These one's should be more chaotic, they should be fickle deities. While the surface gods are all connected by the same goal (undecided), the dungeon gods are all seperate, keeping to themselves outside the occasional scuffle/teritorial dispute.

I already have an idea for a Dungeon god design (that you fight and probably lose to). I've made a pintrest board for some design concepts.
