### Of The Surface

They should be helpful, if a bit cold/detached at times. They don't actively hate you but they also don't really care that much about your survival.<br>
These gods are the ones to give you a second (arguably worse) life, they are also the ones to give you powerful gifts that have various effects.


### Of The Dungeon

These one's should be more chaotic, they should be fickle deities. While the surface gods are all connected by the same goal (undecided), the dungeon gods are all seperate, keeping to themselves outside the occasional scuffle/teritorial dispute.

I already have an idea for a surface god design (that you fight and probably lose to)
