There are multiple origins for you to choose from when you start the game, each having different stat spreads but they have no narritive impact aside from that.

You start with no memory and an odd taste in your mouth, like you were drinking ash.

## <font id="gods" color="#FFF">The Gods</font>

There will be two classifications of gods, Surface and Sepulture.<br>
The entirety of the game will take place in a deep sprawling dungeon, called the Sepulture, built to contain the corpse of a powerful god.

These gods are the ones to give you a second (arguably worse) life, they are also the ones to give you powerful gifts that have various effects.

They want you to climb to the surface
