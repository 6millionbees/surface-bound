## <font id="sepulture" color="#A98">Sepulchre Gods</font>

These gods are chaotic, they should be fickle deities born from death. While the surface gods are all connected by the same goal (to get the power of the long dead god of energy), the dungeon gods are all seperate, keeping to themselves outside the occasional scuffle/teritorial dispute.

I already have an idea for the design for a god (that you fight and probably lose to). I've made a pintrest board to put some design concepts

### <font id="vehement" color="#ED8">Vehement</font>

God of energy, the one who does not give or take, the one who always is. Vehement is dead, or rather as dead as a foundational god can be. Their will remains buried deep in the Sepulchre 


### <font id="fire" color="#F30">Flauros</font>

There's going to  be multiple endings to this game because I need it for my health.

One of the endings you betray the surface, following the allure of power that The First Flame promises. If you follow Flaurous blindly, he does give you the power of the long dead god, as promised, before consuming you in his flames. Taking the power stored within your blood for himself.

If you investigate the dungeon, exploring it thouroughly, then you discover a triangular seal which states (something along the lines of):

> Hold it to the <font color="#F30">source of all flame</font> and gain the <font color="#FFF">truth</font>.

<sub>this is a reference to the actual Flaurous who will lie and cheat unless placed within a magic triangle</sub>

If you do as the scroll says and hold it up to Flaurous he gets scared and upset

## <font id="surface" color="#6CF">Surface Gods</font>

These gods are the ones to give you a second (probably worse) life along with powerful gifts that have various effects.

They want you to climb to the surface
