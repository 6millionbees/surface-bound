### Marrow

Durability. You take less damage, have more health, get hungry slower, and take less damage to poison.

### Sinew

You deal more damage (pysically). It can also be a requirement for wielding some weapons or doing some tasks. It also allows you to intimidate people. Intimidation will be a battle of sinew between two individuals. If you win the npc suddenly becomes much more agreeable

### Tact

Allows you to understand the world around you. Makes you more accurate and quicker. You have a greater understanding of what you perceive with your five senses.

### Acumen

You know more, just in general. You can manipulate people into agreeing with you, you have a way with words. You can understand the mental states of beings and you have a greater understanding of the arcane.<br>
It increases magic damage.

### Faith

You trust easier. High faith builds should have more options to just be better people (and get rewarded for it through buffs or other reawards). This stat also increases your mental connection with the divine, buffing the effects of your prayers and holy magic.

### Gifts

You get better stuff from the gods above.
