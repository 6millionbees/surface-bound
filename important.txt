way longer string for testing purposes; chai is really hot and cool and hot and cool and I love their nose and I love their brain and I love the little hairs on their neck and I love the way their cheeks are shaped and I love their increadibly huggable form and I love their smile and I love their freak nature and I love how their hair curls and I love how their hips are murderous and I love them so so so so so so so so so much I wish them nothing but the best they deserve the most comfort and safety they deserve the world they deserve better but who am I to question who they love they are so perfect their eyes are beautiful their hair is gorgeous their cheeks are cute their smile is precious they're perfect in every way I love them I love them I love them and they are stuck in my mind how am I supposed to stay solid how am I supposed to not melt the moment I see them they're so hot they're so hot they're so hot they're so hot I love them... I love them a lot
